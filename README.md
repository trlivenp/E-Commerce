## Description
This project was primarily a back-end project. I was provided starter code and I was  tasked to properly utilize routes and properly construct the models. Once successfuly the project is abled to be opened in insomnia and the routes display the data in each GET, PUSh, PUT etc routes. I got ample experience with using insomnia as well as a proper understanding of how ecah model relates to each other and how that is important.
